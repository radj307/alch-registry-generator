# [alch](https://github.com/radj307/caco-alch-potion-builder) Registry Builder
This is the utility used to generate the ingredients registry for my CLI potion builder / general alchemy utility project.

The benefits of using this over a static pre-defined list include:
- Automatically Adapts to your Load Order.
- Easier to Extend.
- Compatible with any mod.
- Always accurate. (So long as you rebuild the registry whenever you change a mod that adds ingredients)

# Usage
#### See the usage page on the [wiki](https://github.com/radj307/caco-alch-registry-builder/wiki#usage) for detailed usage instructions.
