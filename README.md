# CACO Potion Builder - Ingredient Registry Utility
This is a simple utility program I threw together in 15 minutes for usage with my [potion builder utility](https://github.com/radj307/caco-alch-potion-builder).  
Currently uses the Synthesis framework, will likely be ported to use only Mutagen later.
